          <p>Agnes, just stop and think a minute <br>
            Why don't you light that cigarette and <br>
            Calm down now stop and breathe a second <br>
            Go back to the very beginning <br>
            Can't you see what was different then? <br>
            You were just popping Percocet <br>
            Maybe just four a week at best <br>
            Maybe a smoke to clear the head <br>
          </p>
          <p>
            Your head is so numb <br>
            That nervous breath you try to hide <br>
            Between the motions <br>
            That trembling tender little sigh <br>
            And so it goes <br>
            A choking rose back <br>
            To be reborn <br>
          </p>

        <div class="column-33">

            I want to hold you like you're mine <br>
            You see the sad in everything a <br>
            Genius of love and loneliness and <br>
            This time you overdid the liquor <br>
            This time you pulled the fuckin' trigger <br>
            These days you're rolling all the time <br>
            So low so you keep getting high <br>

            Guess life is long <br>
            When soaked in sadness <br>
            On borrowed time <br>
            From Mr. Madness <br>
            And so it goes <br>
            A choking rose back <br>
